# my-project - **Abracadabra version**
Code for linguistics experiment. Alternates between 4 stimuli lists and ask participants to rate them on a 7 points scale. 
Instructions and accompanying text are in Italian.
No stimuli are provided. 
It does not have the JATOS bit, so it won't work on JATOS as it is. 
This version is for display only: it shows people how the experiment will look like.
